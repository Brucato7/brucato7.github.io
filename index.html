		<h2>The Life and Times of Jon Weisse</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<h4>The Early Years</h4>
				<p>Jon was born to his parents in May of 1991 in the town of Columbus, Ohio. After spending two peaceful weeks in Ohio, Jon's parents uprooted and moved him and his older brother to Illinois. This move was very hard on little Jon having to make all new friends in this new place. Thankfully, Jon's mother was a human friend making machine, and he was soon joined by his little sister Lydia. Before he could reach kindergarten the family uprooted again, this time moving to Virginia. In Virginia the family was introdued to a new friend in new baby sister, Abby. Then the family uprooted again, for the last time, to Wisconsin. Here the final addition to the family was made in new baby brother Mike.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<h4>The Formative Years</h4>
				<p>Jon attended a public elementary school where he started to learn how uncool he was. In those years he decided to stop being uncool and just start being awesome! Just then, however, a mighty set back happened. Jon's parents switched him out of public school and moved him into a Catholic middle school. Here the uncool tried to drown Jon, but Jon trudged through until he finally emerged into highschool. In highschool Jon tried to rise above the uncool by joining football and track. He did excell in track, but something was missing. Around Jon's junior year Jon remembered his quest for awesomeness. He quit football and track and instead took up Forensics and Theatre. There  his capacity for awesomeness expanded and prepared him for the awesome to come.</p>

				<h4>Don't Stop Awesoming</h4>
				<p>After highschool, Jon attended UW-Oshkosh for Theatre-Acting. While awesomely performing in over twelve awesome plays, Jon picked up tons of technical skills like lighting and set building. More importantly he met someone who equalled, nay, surpassed his level of awesome. This person was his future wife Abby. After earning his bachelor's degree, Jon interned with the awesome Peninsula Players in Door County. During this period in his life the prophecy was fulfilled. What prophecy? This one:</p>
				<blockquote id="prophecy">"When the seagull defecates in the lake,<br>
				and shakes his head underneath the water,<br>
				find the one who is more awesomer and<br>
				present a ring to place upon her fing'r."
				</blockquote>
				<p>After the awesome prophecy was fulfilled Jon and Abby married in July of 2014 and have been awesome ever since.</p>
